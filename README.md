# UnrealEngineAndCppUdemyCourseSection3
Code I wrote while following the " The Unreal Engine Developer Course - Learn C++ &amp; Make Games" course on Udemy. This is all my code made during the third section of the course. The goal was here to create a simple game with the use of Unreal Engine and C++.

The result of the game can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5LXBrvHGVc&feature=youtu.be
